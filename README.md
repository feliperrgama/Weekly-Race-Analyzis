# Weekly-Race-Analyzis
The goal of this project is to analyze data from my weekly runs. I will analyze the gradual evolution of my physical potential and make predictions about where I might be in a few years, taking into account aspects such as distance, speed, and running time. This assumes that the frequency of my runs remains the same.
